# Haive Framework - Centralized Orchestrator

## What is Haive?

Haive is a comprehensive AI agent framework that provides everything you need to build, test, and deploy intelligent AI systems. With 50+ pre-built agents, 40+ game environments, 110+ integrated tools, and a powerful orchestration layer, Haive is the most complete solution for agent-based AI development.

## Core Purpose

The Haive orchestrator serves as the central nervous system for:

1. **Agent Orchestration**: Coordinate complex multi-agent workflows
2. **Dynamic Composition**: Build and modify AI systems at runtime
3. **Unified Interface**: Single entry point to a vast ecosystem of capabilities

## Key Features at a Glance

- **50+ Pre-built Agents**: From simple chatbots to complex research systems
- **40+ Game Environments**: Test and train agents in competitive scenarios
- **110+ Tool Integrations**: Connect to any API or service
- **100+ MCP Servers**: Direct integration with Model Context Protocol
- **Dynamic Architecture**: Everything can be composed and modified at runtime
- **Full Serialization**: Save and restore complete agent states
- **Production Ready**: Built for scale with proper monitoring and persistence

## What Haive Does

### 1. Dynamic Agent Orchestration

Haive allows you to create and modify AI agents on the fly. Unlike traditional frameworks where agent behavior is fixed at design time, Haive agents can:

- **Adapt their behavior** based on context or requirements
- **Add or remove capabilities** during execution
- **Share state and knowledge** between different agent instances
- **Serialize and restore** their complete state for persistence

**Example Use Case**: An agent that starts as a simple chatbot but dynamically adds research capabilities when it detects the user needs in-depth information.

### 2. Graph-Based Workflow Management

Every Haive agent is built on a graph architecture where:

- **Nodes** represent distinct processing steps (LLM calls, tool usage, decision points)
- **Edges** define the flow between steps
- **Conditions** enable dynamic routing based on results

This allows complex workflows like:

- Multi-stage reasoning with checkpoints
- Parallel processing with synchronization points
- Conditional flows based on intermediate results
- Human-in-the-loop interactions

### 3. Intelligent Tool Integration

Haive provides a sophisticated tool system where:

- Tools can be **dynamically bound** to agents
- The framework **automatically routes** requests to appropriate tools
- Tools can have **structured inputs/outputs** with validation
- **Tool selection** can be forced or left to agent discretion

### 4. Game-Based Testing Environments

Unique to Haive is the concept of "agent games" - competitive environments where:

- Agents can be tested against each other
- Performance metrics are automatically tracked
- Strategies can be evolved through gameplay
- Real-world scenarios can be simulated safely

## Key Capabilities

### Runtime Composition

```python
# Start with a basic agent
agent = haive.create_agent("analyzer")

# Dynamically add capabilities
agent.add_tool(WebSearchTool())
agent.add_engine(DataAnalysisEngine())

# Modify behavior on the fly
agent.set_temperature(0.2)  # Make it more focused
agent.enable_streaming()    # Enable real-time output
```

### State Management

```python
# Full state serialization
state = agent.save_state()

# Restore later or on different machine
restored_agent = haive.load_agent(state)

# Continue exactly where you left off
restored_agent.continue_conversation()
```

### Multi-Agent Coordination

```python
# Create specialized agents
researcher = haive.create_agent("researcher", tools=[WebSearch, PDFReader])
writer = haive.create_agent("writer", model="gpt-4")
critic = haive.create_agent("critic", temperature=0.1)

# Orchestrate them together
haive.run_workflow([
    researcher.research(topic),
    writer.draft(researcher.output),
    critic.review(writer.output),
    writer.revise(critic.feedback)
])
```

## Architecture Philosophy

Haive is built on several key principles:

1. **Everything is an Engine**: Uniform interface for all components
2. **Composition over Inheritance**: Build complex behaviors by combining simple ones
3. **Runtime over Compile-time**: Decisions and modifications happen during execution
4. **Explicit over Implicit**: Clear configuration and behavior
5. **Serializable by Default**: Everything can be saved and restored

## Future Roadmap

- **Web UI**: Visual agent builder and monitoring dashboard
- **Cloud Deployment**: Managed Haive instances with scaling
- **Marketplace**: Share and discover agent templates and tools
- **Enhanced Games**: More complex simulation environments
- **Performance Optimizations**: Faster execution and lower latency
